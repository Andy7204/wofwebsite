<div class="card">
<h1>Who we are?</h1>
We are a group of people from another nation sim known as Politics and War. When we heard about Affairs and Order, we knew it had a lot of potential, and we wanted to support it in any way we could, including be an active playerbase even before the gae got released.
</div>
<div class="card">The founders of Wings of Fire
<p>The people who started working on Wings of Fire were Ferrumite666, Sir Francis and A Human Being, who later also got joined by Percy Jackson, the current leader. 
These 4, along with a few other people, have decided on the core values, themes, and the rules regarding the Wings of Fire. 
They chose those themes because they best represented the values that the Wings of Fire stands for.</p>
</div>
<div class="card"> The members
<p>Of course, we wouldn't have an alliance without our loyal members helping us reach this point. 
Our members come from many different backgrounds and hold many different beliefs, but they all fundamentally agree with our core values because otherwise they wouldn't be here. 
Many of them also joined the government, helping us do our job better and helping us reach even higher heights. We cannot thank them enough!</p>
